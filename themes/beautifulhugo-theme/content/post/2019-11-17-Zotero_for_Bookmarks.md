Every Internet browser has the useful capability of bookmarking favorite websites that you may wish to revisit. Some browsers allow for folders to organize your bookmarks, but there's a better option for keeping track of your website discoveries.

## Zotero is a bookmark manager on steroids
Two clicks (or even one) is all it takes to file a website in your Zotero citation manager. One click records the URL, website title, date the site was visited, and it captures a replica of the webpage. A second click may be needed to file the site in a subject folder.

After your site is added to Zotero you can add tags, notes, and attachments. Tags link all citations that have the same tag. When you click on a tag all of the other items that have that tag are assembled together. Notes can include any text that you wish. Attachments can be any files type.

The [Adding Items to Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero) documentation on the Zotero website is clear and comprehensive. Zotero can also be used to collect your [RSS feeds](https://www.zotero.org/support/feeds) to read anytime, with an easy option to add feed content to your Zotero library. Try it out with the [RSS feed from the SoCoHist Blog](https://socohist.netlify.com/index.xml).

Mobile device users can add sites to their Zotero library from various browsers using the [Zotero Bookmarklet](https://www.zotero.org/downloadbookmarklet).
