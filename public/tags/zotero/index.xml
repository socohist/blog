      <description>Every Internet browser has the useful capability of bookmarking favorite websites that you may wish to revisit. Some browsers allow for folders to organize your bookmarks, but there&amp;rsquo;s a better option for keeping track of your website discoveries.
Zotero is a bookmark manager on steroids Two clicks (or even one) is all it takes to file a website in your Zotero citation manager. One click records the URL, website title, date the site was visited, and it captures a replica of the webpage.</description>
